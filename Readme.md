## üéØ Project Objectives

1. Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand trends and correlations.  
2. Analyze the impact of academic scores, degree type, and work experience on placements.  
3. Build **predictive models** (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.) to classify placement status.  
4. Visualize the insights using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3**  
- **NumPy** ‚Äì numerical computing  
- **Pandas** ‚Äì data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** ‚Äì data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** ‚Äì machine learning models  

## A few points to note:-

The dataset used in the project has been provided for reference: Jain University Bangalore Campus Placement Dataset- **Placement.csv** Contains 215 student records Includes secondary and higher secondary school percentages and specialization Also includes degree specialization, type and work experience, and salary offers to the placed students Placed (label = 1) Not Placed (label = 0) 90/10 train/test split

Our model may not achieve the best accuracy(fiddling with the various parameters may enhance it)
